        <p>Hi, I am Toni, the developer of this website and of all programs, code snippets
          and tools made by ToniF03.</p>
        <p>
          I am <a id="age">__</a> years old, and have been interested in programming since I was 11. I first began
          learning to code when I was in middle school, and I've been hooked ever since. Furthermore, I love the
          challenge of solving problems and creating new things using code, and I'm constantly learning and growing as a
          developer. My experience and skill set have grown from that first time when I started to play with some basic
          scripts and has advanced over time, now I am more confident and capable.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am doing my Bachelor of
          Science in Computer Science and can not wait to do more interesting projects.</p>
        <p>Read more about me in my <a href="resume">resume</a>.</p>
