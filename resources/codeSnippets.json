It defines methods to encrypt a plain text string into a byte array and to decrypt a byte array back into a string. The AES key and initialization vector (IV) are hardcoded as string constants and must meet the required lengths (32 characters for the key and 16 for the IV). The implementation uses .NET's `System.Security.Cryptography` library and handles the encryption and decryption in-memory using streams.",
